      <h2 class="subsection"> About myself</h2>
        <p class="center">  Hello! my name is Winta Gebreslassie and I'm a senior Biomedical Engineering
          student at the University of The District of Columbia. Currently
          my team and I are designing and simulating our senior capston project. Our design
          project is Infant Incubator that works without electricity aiming
          for a people who lives in a low income comminity. Our heat source is
          Phase Change Material (PCM). </p>

        <p>People that live in a low-income countries,half of the babies born at
           or below 32 weeks die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective care,
           such as warmth, breastfeeding support, and basic care for infections
           and breathing difficulties.According to the World Health Organization
           (WHO), An estimated 15 million babies are born too early every year.
           That is more than 1 in 10 babies. Approximately 1 million children die
           each year due to complications of preterm birth. Increase in birth rate
           of premature babies with lower birth weight and other defects is a major
           factor that drives us to build our neonate incubator. Our main goal is
            to design and build an efficient and cost effective incubator that
            works without electricity to meet people that live in a low income
            countries.<br>
Neonate incubator primarily provide humidity, warmth and oxygen in a controlled
environment. The infant incubator is consists of an enclosed chamber, with a small
mattress on the top covered by a rigid plastic cover. The chamber protects the baby
 from noise, dust, and infection. To achieve all these our incubator will be made
 with wood for the base, and acrylic top with a front door that allows parents to
 put the neonate inside. Phase Change Material will be used to generate the heat.
 Heat for its operation can be provided by PCM source.In addition of air blower
 fan to circulate the air inside the incubator. Once set, the temperature is
 maintained automatically with the control system which makes the system easy to
 operate. The system will control it automatically via sensors placed inside the
 incubator. It is also designed to address unique challenges present in the places it
is intended to be used. The market for our product will be mainly for people who
live in low-income area. This market has the greatest ability to take advantage
of the type of incubator that we will design. In these places, there is a need
for incubators and there is no need access to electricity.</p>


       <h1>Solid-Works of Incubator</h1>
       <h2 id="Architecture1">Architecture 1</h2>
        <p>The team come up with two different architectures. The first
          architecture was considered that the PCM would be the base of the
          mattress of the baby, where natural air flow would flow inside the
          incubator and transfer heat with the PCM while inside. The issue with
          this designs are that the baby would be disturb every time the PCM
          should be removed from the incubator, and the high efficiency
          particular air (HEPA) filter would interfered in the air flow.
          For the filter solution, we discussed the use of an external U.V light
           that could kill the bacteria of the air that is flowing to the baby area.
        </p>

      <h3>Phase change material inside incubator</h3>

 <h2 id="Architecture2">Architecture 2</h2>
<p>The second architecture was considered that our PCM would be outside of the
  incubator in order to not disturb the baby and do not lose the heat because the
   incubator would not be opened for heat source re-heat step. The PCM would be
   inside a box and it would work as a heat exchanger, where copper pipe would
   flow through the phase change material before flow through the inside of the baby.
   The cons of this architecture is that there would be need a subsystem to spin
   a fan so air could go through the pipeline. However, the HEPA filter could be
   applied once air is forced flowing to the incubator.

        <h1>Engineering Specification</h1>
        <h2 id="Engineering Discussion">Engineering Discusion</h2>
        <p>The design parameters were established upon researching the average
          size of new born baby, the needs of premature baby, and  the standard
           safety of FDA. Temperature range (36.5 C-kg/for babies in +-30 weeks
           and 37.2 C-kg/ in +-28 weeks).
It is better that the incubator is light in weight so that it can be  portable
at  the  same  time  provides  strong  support  for  the components   used  and   can   bear   the   weight   of   the   infant. Isolation  of  the  compartment  where  the  baby  is  kept  from  the controlling  unit  is  a  necessary  requirement.  The  incubator design can be divided into four subsystems: structural support, enclosure,  shell,  and  bed.  The  structural  support  is  the  device that accommodate the other subsystems and the preterm infant. Design Parameters: Length 40 cm, Height 60 cm, Width 40 cm thickness  of  material  5mm.  Control  unit  inside
the  box  will have  a dimension  of  10  cm  x  30  cm  x  30  cm. The control
 unit is responsible  for  holding  the  heat  exchanger and the  electrical
 components  needed  for  the  incubator  to  work.  The  shell  is responsible
  for  retaining  the  heated  air,  preventing  airborne infections  from
  reaching  the  preterm  infant,  and  venting  the stagnant air. The  bed is
  intended to keep the  preterm infant in place. The figure below shows  image
   of  the  3D  model  of incubator structure designed by Computer Aided Design.
So,we chose the height ,length and width dimensions based the new born premature
baby size which is roughly 16 inches and 3lbs. The normal human body temperature
is 37 0C,so the temperature inside the incubator has to be same since we do not
know yet baby body temperature.Since it's a premature baby his/her skin is too
soft and try quick to avoid the danger we set the humidity from 50-90\% to keep
 baby skin moisturize.We decide to have 2 portholes and 2 main doors to ease
  carrying the ICU's and also.It's easy to check on the baby instead open the
  top which save the baby heat.The main reason we chose to make this incubator
  lbs 20 because it designs for low-income and villages people, it has to be
  light and easy to carry around.</p>

       <h2 id=SolutionandEngineeringestimation>Solution and Engineering estimation</h2>
       <p>
         We are trying to isolate area inside the environment of incubator with
         no dust ,bacteria ,and has the ability to control temperature, humidity,
         and oxygen to remain them in acceptable levels. We design to keep baby
         warm,to monitor many of their vital body functions like heart rate, blood
         pressure,oxygen saturation and to support their breathing if necessary.
         Regarding the temperature and humidity control, incubators should minimize
         heat loss from the neonate and eddies around him/her.The main physical
         variables affecting the incubator environment are temperature, humidity,oxygen.<br>
Our mathematical model shows that our main heat losses of the system are conduction
 and convection n the incubator walls and due radiation. In order to decrease
 the heat losses of our system we could change our design by changing the material
  of the walls leaving one or two main walls made by acrylic so there is still
  visualization of the baby without opening the incubator. Selecting the right
  material for this project is essential in order to keep it a low cost but still
  efficient.<br>
Calculations must be made in order to analyse if the peltier and seebeck effect
could be applied in order to generate electricity from the difference of temperature
of our heat-source and the outside air. Other system discussed was the convertion of
potential energy (using mass and height) to rotate the fan. Further discussion would
be made with the instructor Dr. Nitsche so the group can come up with the solution.

  Manufacturers respond to these demands by introducing double-walled incubators
  to reduce an infant’s radiated heat loss. Active humidification systems will
  develop for the precise control of humidity. State of the art microprocessor-based
  controls enabled precise temperature settings and a variety of alarms.
  Sophisticated air flow systems will design to maintain temperature stability
  and minimize the effects of opened access doors. Parents will give the option
  of automatically maintaining heater temperature either by measuring the chamber
  or the infant’s temperature. Many problems like hypothermia, dehydration will
  occur in infants if they have less humidity.These problems can be reduced if
  the preterm infants are nursed at high relative humidity. Also the skin temperature
   increases and the distribution of surface temperature will be more if an infant
   is nursed at a high humidity.

  <h2 id="Conclusion and Future work">Conclusion and Future work</h2>
  <p>
  Our conclusion is that our project is doable. We can design a low cost incubator
  using phase change material as a heat source. Future work for MECH 492 will be
  designing a subsystem that can generate electricity or a mechanism that can spin
  the fan so air can be forced through our PCM; make mathematical model with upgraded
  materials in order to reduce the heat losses due radiation and convection; build the
  electric circuit of our humidifier and temperature display; construct a CAD model
  after the mathematical model is with the desirable results and simulate our incubator
  using COMSOL. We are hoping that the COVID-19 settle during the semester and maybe
  1our class can be hybrid during the summer 2020 so we can build our project.
